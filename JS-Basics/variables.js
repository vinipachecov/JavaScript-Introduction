// var "nameofthevariable" 


// note that we don't have to put the type of the variable! :)
// semicolons are back if you come from python paradigm

// Basic types are 

// numbers - all numbers

// strings -- sequence of characters

// boolean -- true or false values

// udenfined - when a variable is not assigned a value

// null -- macro null

// DINAMYC TYPING :)))

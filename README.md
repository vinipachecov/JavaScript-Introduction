# javascript-Introduction
This is my personal code for the "The Complete JavaScript Course: Build a Real-World Project | Udemy".


The source codes here show examples of the very basics aspects of javascripts. 
It was done by following the course on Udemy and I inserted some comments.

Technologies Used:

* VSCode (live server extension helps alot if you need to debug client-server functions like prompt, alert, etc...)
* NodeJS (very useful for fast debugging more common code without client server functions)
